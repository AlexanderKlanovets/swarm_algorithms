# Swarm intelligence algorithms implementation

The algorithms developed in this repository are part of my Bachelor's diploma thesis dedicated to designing a system based on multicriteria swarm algorithms for tuning artificial neural networks.

### Repository contents
- an implementation of different swarm intelligence algorithms (for now, specifically for unconstrained continuous optimization problems with a single objective);
- a set of test objective functions to experiment with and use them for models' tests;
- a utility for optimization process visualization;
- a Jupyter notebook with a usage and visualization demo (animations don't work properly on a Github Jupyter notebook viewer).

### Feel free to comment the code (especially if you find something incorrect).
