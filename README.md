# Swarm intelligence algorithms implementation

## Please, let me know, if I have any mistakes in my code. It will help me a lot.

This repository contains examples of so called swarm intelligence algorithms implemented in __Python__.

The purpose of this repository is to implement the algorithms from scratch and get better understanding of how they actually work. This code is not intended to be used for production.

There will be more content in the future, including jupyter notebook demos to have fun with.
